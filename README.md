This project is made as a local-network file transfer program. I am learning the basics of Java's socket programming system through this project. If there is anything that I could be doing better, I am happy to take suggestions! Thank you for visiting!


#Edit#: Currently on a hold on this project. I have a strong desire to finish it, but between current classes and some networking hurdles to understand (networking professionals blocking the ability to ping local devices), there aren't very many intuitive additions that can be made right now if I will have to fundamentally change everything later on.
